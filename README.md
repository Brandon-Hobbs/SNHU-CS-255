SNHU CS-255 Systems Analysis and Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

I believe that client DriverPass (Liam, Owner and Ian, CIO) wants to create an online LMS (Learning Management System) and a system to schedule their services.
This LMS shall allow users to train for their driver’s test. The LMS should allow the user to create their own learning plan from multiple defined packages and track their progress. The LMS should also allow application owners to interact with users through direct feedback or to update lesson plans if the source material changes

Moreover, if the students want to schedule one-on-one (reservations) for in person driving lessons they need to be able to do so.
The system is targeted to fill the “void in the market for training drivers at the DMV” and address the issue of “so many people failing at the DMV”. The system will allow users to enroll in enough physical and/or virtual training until they can pass their tests.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think there can always be more elaboration in Requirements and User Stories. If I could go back I would rework the Requirements document to have a bit more clarity, especially around the Technical Requirements.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user is important because they are the user. Sure, that sounds obvious, but it is important to repeat that to yourself when doing a design. It doesn’t matter if you, the developer, have a preference you are not the intended audience.
To help interpret a user’s needs using the 5 Why’s method might shorten the experiment/failure/refine loop.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think trying to understand what a user needs and then help them to achieve that in as few steps as possible is the hallmark of good design. Using the UML diagrams can help breaks these needs down into a visual way that others can then challenge and refine.
